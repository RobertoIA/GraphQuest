<p>
  GraphQuest is a assisted design desktop tool that evolves schematic levels for adventure videogames.
  The designer may specify a number of parameter and restrictions for the algorithm to work with, and can be used to explore alternatives to an existing level or to quickly generate prototypes during the design process. 
</p>
<p>
  This proyect uses a evolutionary algorithm capable of producing a variety of levels for any combination of input parameters.
  Every generated level is guaranteed to be playable, that is, it has a set entrace point, the player can access every room and no door is without a key.
</p>
<p>
  Game levels are divided in zones, accessible with the use of a key that is always located in one of the previous zones.
  This mechanic grants to the level a well defined order of traversal that the player has to follow.
  Each one of the zones is further divided into a set of interconnected rooms, that can be accesses in any order, and that are assigned content.
</p>
<p>
  The types of content that a room can contain are defined by the designer, and are meant to provide a level of challenge and reward to the level.
  The relative proportions of content can be used as a search parameter for the algorithm.
